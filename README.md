# Disease-Prediction

## 💡Inspiration
Ever since the pandemic has hit we humans need to carefully monitor our health, for it is our biggest assest. So I have made a python-tinkter based disease recommendation prototype that predicts a disease based on symptoms you are going through

## 🧩What it does
Aware-ify predicts disease based upon the symptoms that you are having. All you need to do is enter five symptoms from the drop down menu and it will tell you what disease you may be having.

## 🛠 How we built it
I used python libraries numpy, pandas and tinkter to build it 

## 🎯Challenges we ran into
Integrating the tinkter with the prototype.

## 🏆Accomplishments that we're proud of
Completed the project as per the plan. We are proud of creating a full-fledged application prototype 

## 📖What we learned
Learned about new Python libraries.

## ⛳️What's next for Aware-ify
Providing users with a more personalized dashboard along with further adding and improving the predictions.
